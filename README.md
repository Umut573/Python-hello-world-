In order to use Python, you first need to install it on your computer.
Installation for Windows
 * Go to Python Official Website: Go to python.org/downloads/ in your browser.
 * Download Installation File: Usually the latest version is at the top. Click on the button that says "Download Python X.X.X" (where X.X.X represents the version number, for example 3.10.0) to download the Windows Installer (64-bit) or Windows Installer (32-bit) file. If you don't know whether your computer is 64-bit or 32-bit, it is usually safe to choose the 64-bit version.
 * Start Setup: Double click on the .exe file you downloaded.
 * Important Step - Add PATH: When the installation window opens, make sure to check the box at the bottom that says "Add Python X.X to PATH". This will allow you to easily run Python from the command prompt.
 * Complete Installation: Click the "Install Now" button and wait for the installation to finish. When the process is complete, you will see the message "Setup was successful".
Installation for macOS
 * Go to Python Official Website: Go to python.org/downloads/ in your browser.
 * Download Installation File: Usually the latest version is at the top. Click the button that says "Download Python X.X.X.X" (where X.X.X.X represents the version number) to download the macOS 64-bit universal2 installer.
 * Start Installation: Double click on the .pkg file you downloaded and follow the steps in the installation wizard. You will usually be able to accept the default settings.
